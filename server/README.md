# Return_Contribution_Python

## Project Description

This R script generates a fully automated, professional-grade Excel report for portfolio performance and attribution analysis. It reads two input Excel files: (1) portfolio weights (tickers in column 1, weights per date in subsequent columns), and (2) mutual fund NAV history (same structure, used when Yahoo Finance data is unavailable). It fetches real-time market prices via quantmod (Yahoo Finance) for stocks (.TO for TSX), ETFs, indices (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC, ACWI, ^GSPTSE), and FX (CAD=X). For each period between weight dates, it computes: Return = (P_end / P_start) – 1, Contribution = Weight × Return, and applies CAD adjustment to non-CAD, non-mutual-fund assets using multiplicative FX return: (1 + R_asset) × (1 + R_FX) – 1. The special ticker $CASH$ is forced to 0% return and contribution in all periods, including YTD. Cumulative (YTD) metrics are calculated as total return from first to last date and sum of period contributions. The data frame is structured with columns grouped per period: Weight | Return | Contrib. | (spacer), followed by YTD Return | YTD Contrib.. Holdings are sorted by descending YTD contribution. A TOTAL row shows: weight sum = 100.00%, contribution sums per period and YTD, and blank returns. A blank spacer row separates holdings from benchmarks. Benchmarks (USD/CAD, S&P 500, Dow Jones, Nasdaq, ACWI, TSX60) display returns only (in domestic currency), with weights and contributions blank. The Excel output uses openxlsx to create: a merged title, period spanners (e.g., "01/01/2025 to 31/03/2025"), cumulative header, full % formatting (0.00%) on all numeric cells, conditional formatting (green if ≥0, red if <0 on all Contrib. and YTD Contrib. columns), weight change background (green tint if increase, red tint if decrease vs prior period), bold-italic holdings, blue-filled TOTAL row, color-coded benchmark rows (yellow, blue, red), optimized column widths, and right-aligned footnotes ("Benchmarks Returns are in Domestic Currency", "Portfolio Holdings Returns are CAD Adjusted"). All numeric columns are safely converted to numeric and scaled ×100 before writing to Excel to ensure correct % display. The script is fully dynamic (any number of periods/tickers), robust (tryCatch on data fetch), and requires internet. Output saved to C:/Users/Phili/Downloads/table_output.xlsx (overwrites). To port to Python, replicate: (1) pandas for data handling, (2) yfinance for market data, (3) xlwings or openpyxl + pandas.Style for formatting, (4) identical logic for FX, $CASH$, TOTAL, sorting, and blanking, (5) exact styling via cell-level formatting (merged cells, conditional rules, colors, number formats). Requires: pandas, yfinance, openpyxl, xlwings (optional), internet. This design ensures audit-ready, client-facing output with zero manual intervention.
